## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using medical attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure. A web interface built with Streamlit allows users to input patient data and get real-time predictions.

## 📊 Dataset

We used the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Database** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains data on female patients of Pima Indian heritage aged 21 and above.

- 📁 Rows: 768
- 📁 Columns: 8 medical parameters + target label
