ðŸ§  Random Forest Classification â€“ Description and Usage in Diabetes Prediction Project
ðŸ“Œ What is Random Forest Classification?
Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by building multiple decision trees during training time and outputting the majority class (for classification) or the average prediction (for regression) of the individual trees.

It is called a "forest" because it uses an ensemble (group) of decision trees, each trained on different random subsets of data and features, which helps reduce overfitting and improves accuracy and generalization.

ðŸ”§ How It Works (In Simple Steps)
Randomly selects subsets of features and samples from the dataset.

Builds several decision trees independently.

Each tree gives a prediction.

The majority vote (in classification) is taken as the final output.

âœ… Why Random Forest in  Diabetes Project?
In  Diabetes Prediction Project, i used Random Forest Classification because:

It handles tabular medical data well.

It deals with non-linear relationships between features (like glucose, BMI, age).

It automatically handles feature importance and selects the most relevant ones.

Itâ€™s robust to outliers and less prone to overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
